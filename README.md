<h1 align='center'>Degree Final project</h1>

This repository contains all the files submitted for the evaluation of my Computer Science bachelor's degree final project. It consists in a simple web page served by Django that stores all its data in a distributed environment (Apache ZooKeeper) over different servers, as well as the scripts needed to install the required software.

Both the [technical note](https://github.com/xpenalosa/DegreeFinalProject/blob/master/pdf/TFG_XavierPenalosa.pdf) and the website's language is Catalan, which is my native language and the language used to present the project to the jury members.

<p align='center'>The project obtained a score of 9.2/10 on the 31st of January 2019.</p>
